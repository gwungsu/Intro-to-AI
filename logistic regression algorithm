//For this code I first load a dataset using Pandas. The dataset contains features (independent variables) and a target variable (dependent variable) to predict. I then split the data into training and testing sets using train_test_split function from Scikit-Learn.

Then create a logistic regression model using the LogisticRegression class from Scikit-Learn, and train it on the training data using the fit method. After that I use the trained model to make predictions on the test data using the predict method.

Finally, the evaluation of the performance of the model is calculated by the accuracy score on the test data using the accuracy_score function from Scikit-Learn's metrics module.//
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Load data
data = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

# Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(data.drop('target', axis=1), data['target'], test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Create a logistic regression model
model = LogisticRegression()

# Train the model on the training data
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Use the trained model to make predictions on the test data
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model's accuracy on the test data
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)

print(f"Model accuracy: {accuracy}")
